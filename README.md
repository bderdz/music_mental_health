This project showcases my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
It explores the relationship between music preferences, listening habits, and mental health based on survey data. Using Python and data science tools, I performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover patterns in how individuals interact with music and its potential effects on mental well-being.

### Tools & Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Sklearn)
- Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn - Linear Regression, Logistic Regression)
- Google Colab

### Project Overview:
##### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values through imputation and categorical encoding (OrdinalEncoder)
- Converted categorical variables into numerical formats for modeling
- Removed redundant columns and optimized data types for efficient analysis

##### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualized music streaming preferences and their correlation with demographic features
- Analyzed the distribution of music genres and their potential impact on mental health
- Investigated listening habits while working/studying using Seaborn and Plotly

##### Predictive Modeling
- Linear Regression: Used to analyze potential relationships between listening habits and mental health indicators
- Logistic Regression: Applied to classify mental health conditions based on music preferences and behavioral patterns
- Performance Evaluation: Assessed models using R² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), accuracy, and confusion matrix
